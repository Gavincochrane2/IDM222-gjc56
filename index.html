        <p>
            Design 1 for media, Animated gif in 3d space.
             The background is hand painted then put into photoshop where I animated the ball bouncing around using a frame animation

    <br>
            <p>
                The 6 designs are drawn by hand and inspired by the 3 pictures at the bottom,
            I then put them into photoshop to edit the background and combine it with a foreground design that is an abstraction of my initals

                 </span>
                 <br>
                <p>
                    I created a notan out of black paper on a white background and then focused in on one part to create a pattern from. 
                I then filled the pattern with shades of grey and translated it onto the album cover shown in the top left

       <br>
        <p>
            We took portraits that resembled a still from a movie we watched (shown in bottom middle). 
            I then created 2 value scales (one by hand and the other with pieces of a magazine) and translated them onto the portrait of myself according to the value of each section
